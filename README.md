# Decision Tree Classification on Iris Dataset

This project demonstrates the use of a decision tree classifier to classify different species of the Iris flower dataset. The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning, often used for introductory tasks.

## Project Structure
Decision_tree_classification_on_Iris_dataset.ipynb: The main Jupyter notebook that implements the decision tree classifier on the Iris dataset.
Dataset
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples from each of three species of Iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Each sample has four features:

Sepal length
Sepal width
Petal length
Petal width
These features are used to classify the species of the Iris flower.

## Dependencies
To run this notebook, the following dependencies are required:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Scikit-learn
NumPy
Matplotlib
Pandas
